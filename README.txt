This program is capable of doing analyses of lottery games, meaning that, given an input file with correct lottery games (matches the type being expected by the computer, and also the one indicated by the user), it will produce a hot and cold list of numbers.

Also it is capable of generating all possible combinations of numbers given certain constraints such as:

- Range. Example: 1 to 49
- How many numbers to pick. Example: 7
- More than 85 million combinations.

This is specially good if you are looking to play more numbers than you are allowed to play. For example, lets say you desire to play in Lotto max, but you are only allowed to select 7 numbers. How would you play with more than 7 numbers? For example, lets say you want to select 12 numbers by specifying the range and afterwards 7, for how many numbers to be picked. This will generate 792 games improving your chances considerably.
